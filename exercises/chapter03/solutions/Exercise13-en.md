1. Return characters in the string that match the predicate.
2. Return characters in the string that do not match the predicate.
3. Return a string with any characters at the beginning or end that match the
   predicate removed.  This could be used to implement `strip`, a function to
   strip whitespace characters from the beginning and end of a string, for
   example.
4. Return a string with any characters at the beginning that match the
   predicate removed.  This could be used to implement `lstrip`, a function to
   strip whitespace characters from the beginning of a string, for example.
5. Return a string with any characters at the end that match the predicate
   removed.  This could be used to implement `rstrip`, a function to strip
   whitespace characters from the end of a string, for example.
