Chapter 5: Supplement
=====================

isLower, ord, chr
-----------------

`isLower`, `ord`, and `chr` are functions defined in the `Data.Char` module.
They are not defined in the `Prelude` module, so you need to import them
explicitly.  You can do so by putting an import line at the top of your file:

    import Data.Char (chr, isLower, ord)
